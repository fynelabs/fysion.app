Thanks for your interest in the Fysion *Universal App Studio*!

We are very excited to be able to start offering access to the first versions of this exciting new product.
We are welcoming early access to try this out and we are **gathering feedback on the design and workflow**.
We will contact testers to request a little time to discuss your thoughts.

Fysion already allows you to:

* Graphically create native apps that work on all platforms

* Edit theme info and live-preview your app
* Build using many standard widgets and containers
* Work from example template apps and themes for inspiration
